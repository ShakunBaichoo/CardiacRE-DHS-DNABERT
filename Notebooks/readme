# Heart-Specific Regulatory Elements Analysis with DNABERT

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the analysis of heart-specific regulatory elements, leveraging the capabilities of DNABERT. The notebooks guide you through the process of identifying potential regulatory sequences in heart tissue, focusing on understanding their unique roles and functionalities. All downloaded and processed files are stored within this folder.

## Notebook Sets

There are two sets of notebooks:

### Problem 1 Notebooks

The first two notebooks for Problem 1, focused on data preparation, are adapted versions of the notebooks from the [DNA Diffusion project](https://github.com/pinellolab/DNA-Diffusion/blob/main/notebooks/filter_master.ipynb) for loading DHSs. 

1. **Master Dataset Creation**: The first notebook is used to create the master dataset.
2. **Heart DHS Filtering**: The second notebook filters out DHSs related to the heart organ. After filtering, the data is fed to a fine-tuned, pre-trained DNABERT model with `kmers=6`. The steps and details for running this step are provided in **DNABERT Prediction**. The results are analyzed in the third notebook.

### Problem 2 Notebooks

For Problem 2, a custom version of the dataset using the DHSs and the vocabulary is created, followed by DNABERT training and analysis of results, similar to Problem 1.

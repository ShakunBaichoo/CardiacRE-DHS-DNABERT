<h1 align="center">CardiacRE-DHS-DNABERT</h1>
A work-in-progress repository leveraging DHS data and DNABERT for identifying cardiac-specific regulatory elements. It hosts analytical notebooks and tools dedicated to genomic exploration of heart tissues.

Welcome to our repository, where we dive deep into the heart of genomics to map out cardiac-specific regulatory elements. Our mission is to employ a robust blend of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) data and the DNABERT model, a transformative approach to DNA sequence understanding through deep learning.

## Project Overview

The heart is a complex organ with a unique genomic landscape that guides its function and health. Dysregulation of genetic elements can lead to various cardiac conditions. Thus, the precise identification and analysis of these regulatory elements are crucial. In this repository, we focus on uncovering these sequences, with the aim of contributing to the broader understanding of cardiac genetics and potential therapeutic targets.

## What's Inside

- **Computational Notebooks**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks illustrating our methodologies, from data preprocessing to in-depth analysis of predictions generated by DNABERT.
- **Analytical Tools**: Custom scripts and utilities that assist in the identification and characterization of cardiac regulatory elements using DNABERT.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CardiacRE-DHS-DNABERT.git
```

Navigate through the directories to find the resources you need. The notebooks contain comments and documentation to help guide you through the analysis process.

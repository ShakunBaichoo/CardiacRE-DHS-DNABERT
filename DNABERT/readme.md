# DNABERT Prediction
This folder contains the DNABERT fine tuned model using kmers=6.

To use DNABERT we must <b>clone the DNABERT repo</b> and <b><u>set up the environment</u></b> using instructions from the [official DNABERT site](https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT), one level above the current working directory. Hence you will have a folder DNABERT one level above your current working folder, i.e. <b>../DNABERT/</b>

For Problem1, we must next create the subfolder ```/dhs/ft/6/``` in the folder in the folder ```../DNABERT/examples/```. We will next save our datasets for training and testing in the new folder ```../DNABERT/examples/dhs/ft/6/```

For Problem2, we must next create the subfolder ```/dhs2/ft/6/``` in the folder in the folder ```../DNABERT/examples/```. We will next save our datasets for training and testing in the new folder ```../DNABERT/examples/dhs2/ft/6/```

These are already speciified in the notebooks.
